# Bravia IRCC-IP API



Remote controler over IP for Sony Bravia Smart TV pre-Android versions. Protocol is IRCC-IP InfraRed Compatible Control over Internet Protocol implemented inside this TV sets by Sony here description https://pro-bravia.sony.net/develop/index.html. Tested on <B>Sony Bravia KDL-40EX720</B>. Should work with other Sony Smart TV sets manufactured between 2010-2013 before authentication was introducted and then Android as a operating OS but this is not cover by this scripts. If your TV is based on Android OS or need some form of authentication during sending IP commands use [
bravia-auth-and-remote ](https://github.com/breunigs/bravia-auth-and-remote). This script was also inspiration and is based on breunigs work.
 This sets of scripts were created to work with this TV which recive commands without authentication. Buttons set defined in BraviaCommands.sh is for tested TV they may be some variations between models but main buttons should be compatibile with various models. If your TV is also working with this script let me know on Issuses I will be happy addding them to list and my help with preparation of specific remote commands sets for your TV.
